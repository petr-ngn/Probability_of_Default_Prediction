# Probability_of_Default_Prediction
Basic credit risk modelling of probability of default using logistic regression optimized with grid search.
1) Exploratary analysis and cleaning
2) Data split and data preprocessing - dummy encoding, ordinal encoding, discretization
3) Modelling and optimization - logistic regression tuned with grid search
4) Evaluation - confusion matrix, AUC score, ROC curves
